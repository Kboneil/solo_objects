# Object Activity
The reason for this activity is to practice creating objects and incorporating functions into them...and making sure that all the values can be printed out coherently by concatenating them together.

I chose the kids cartoon Doug because I don't know much about any sports team and for some reason a childhood cartoon seemed fun to write about instead. The cast is kind of like a "team".

## Print out
"Doug was created by Jim Jinkins and aired from August 11, 1991 to June 26, 1999. It was set in Bluffington, and follows the life of Doug Funnie, also know as Quailman. Doug Funnie particularly liked The Beets, journaling and playing the banjo. The supporting cast was Skeeter Valentine, the best friend, Roger Klotz, the enemy, Patti Mayonnaise, the love interest, and Porkchop, Doug Funnie's pet."
